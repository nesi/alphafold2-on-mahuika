</center>


!!! circle-info "Description"
    This package provides an implementation of the inference pipeline of AlphaFold v2.0. This is a completely new model that was entered in CASP14 and published in Nature. For simplicity, we refer to this model as AlphaFold throughout the rest of this document.
    
    Any publication that discloses findings arising from using this source code or the model parameters should [cite](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold#citing-this-work) the [AlphaFold paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2). Please also refer to the [Supplementary Information](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-021-03819-2/MediaObjects/41586_2021_3819_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) for a detailed description of the method.
